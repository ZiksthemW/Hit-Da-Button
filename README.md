# Hit-Da-Button
A Game that created while learning PyGame Framework.

It's a simple game about clicking the button that spawns randomly. Of course, you need PyGame framework to run it.

To run it, use this command: `python game.py` or `python3 game.py` 

## In-Game Pictures

As you can tell this game is still on development and needs more improvement and updates. So, ui will be completely changed soon.
